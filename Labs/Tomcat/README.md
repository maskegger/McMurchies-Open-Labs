## CORE FEATURE -  HTTP REQ/RESP MODEL

1. A request made for any dynamic web resource like a JSP Servlet 
2. Servlet is a Specialised JAVA CLASS 
2.1 Handles http requests like GET, POST, PUT etc

3. If the resource called is a JSP - it is translated and compiled into a Servlet before being executed by the container  


##Â TOMCAT COMPONENTS

For End to End Lifecycle Execution Various Components are Required.

## CATALINIA 

- Core container, does init(), Service() , destroy()
- MAIN ROLE - CONTROL LIFECYCLE 
- By Loading, Initializing, Serving and Destroying the Servlet as per Java Specification of JSP and Servlets 
- Manages the whole Bean Lifecycle - it is the core component.

## JASPER 

- JSP Engine
- Converts JSP pages/code to Servlets 
- This happens before servicing the request 
- So if you change JSP mid flight, Jasper can potentially generate the updated servlet in time for the response 

## COYOTE
- Connector component 
- Listens to TCP/IP ports to transmit web requests to container and end users
- Vital in integration with other Web Servers and providing Static Content
- Vital in running the applicaiton on SSL
 
## CLUSTER
- Important whilst running in distributed mode 
- Added to manage large applications 
- Used for load balancing via many techniques 

## Manager Application
