# Automating A Python Script 

![Python and crontab](https://i2.wp.com/blog.eduonix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Linux-Shell-Scripting-29-crontab-and-at-jobs.png?fit=740%2C296&ssl=1) 

In this tutorial I will show you how to use the Mac OS systems Cron job to automate a Python script. So that you can run it at a given time interval. This is a straight forward tutorial, and I do not add in any logic for checking if the job has run already etc.   

For any **Windows Users**, Please try [this](../JenkinsAutomation/README.md)] as it shows you how to automate the execution of a powershell (also scripting like python) with Jenkins (which is also very powerful and extremely useful in an IT career.)
