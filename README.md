## PROJECT SELECTION   

1. **Reporting app** - a fully interactive site where you show the latest figures, trends and graph out the coin reports

2. **Interactive chatbot** - where people can say 'what is the value of x coin in usd' (this one is a different vein of learning, and you pick up stuff like NLP, a bit of AI and how to build sentence pattern recognition)

3. **Automated Trading Bot** You could actually build on this data, build a smart short term trading bot. So something simple that only trades two coin pairs and effectively waits for a return before trading back. (You can then build complexity). I am working on this one myself but been a bit lazy on it

## LEARNING OUTCOMES  

1. **OUTCOMES - Reporting app** Gives you insight into data science, manipulation & presentation of data - and eventually Neural Networks

2. **OUTCOMES -Interactive chatbot** Gives you experience working heavily with parsing, language processing (which is good for summarizing customer reviews, obtaining opinions and sentiments), also huge on the customer side of things with chat interaction, Neural networks would be likely here, but a different kind. RNNs that is neural networks that are focused on 'order of things'.

3. **OUTCOMES -Automated Trading Bot** Highly practical, intimate knowledge working with APIs, processing data, CryptoTransactions, working with CryptoMarkets - but we can apply a much more old school solution to this. No neural nets required in the beginning
