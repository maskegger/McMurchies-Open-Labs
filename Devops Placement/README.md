# LEARNING RESOURCES

What makes DevOps so powerful and sought after a profession is the wide range of skills required. A DevOps specialist must have degrees of experience with - Development, Testing (functional and Quality), Operations, Systems Administration and more. This is because as a DevOps specialist you are responsible for the underlying infrastructure which those Dev, testing and others run on. Duties can involve any of the following and more: 

- Scripting 
- Automation
- System Administration 
- Application Configuration
- Tooling (selecting the best tools for the team to use)
- Team Dashboarding (making a dashboard to centralise data visualization for the team)
- CICD pipeline (building a pipeline in Jenkins to deliver end to end)


Also crucially what differentiates a DevOps engineer from others is the close relation to business, so much so that DevOps engineers often have to think laterally as how to help solve problems from the following points of view:

### Scalability 
Does this feature, product have the ability to grow to meet customer demand. A DevOps engineer solves this problem by building infrastructure that grows and shrinks as required.


### HA (High Availability)

Businesses require their services (applications) to be up at all times for customers, depending on the importance of the application tolerance can be from 2 hours down time to 0 second down time as being acceptible. 
 Architecting a highly available infrastructure is 

### Fault Tolerance

 The business may have a low appetite when it comes to your application dealing with bugs and errors. In many instances applications simply fail

### ThroughPut

Some applications for business care more about the ability to move high volumes of data, such as transaction processing. High throughput is a critical business interest. 

### Monitoring and Metrics

The business need to see how customers are interacting with the website, the app, how the applications are performing and get data to drive improvement. DevOps specialists achieve this by writing scripts to pull data, visualizing it in dashboards and so on.

## Adam McMurchie's GITHUB Walkthroughs 

These may be worth trying, but best to be done on a personal machine.

This links is best in the event you have a windows personal computer.

## OPTIONAL 

An introduction to Cloud computing. [Cloud Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-computing-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
 
## THE PHOENIX PROJECT

One of the best IT books you will ever read, very very popular in all areas of IT and a must for those looking to learn Agile and DevOps practices.

[The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/files/PhoenixProjectExcerpt.pdf)



Devops can be thought of a combination of three main practices - People, Processes and Tools. Succesful automation and Operations require a combinatiton of the right DevOps culture, strong tooling and robust processes which helps both reduce impediments but protects the quality of features being released.



# DELIVERY OBJECTIVES

*NOTE* Some of the below activities may not be possible on a Barclays machine, it is recommended you also try these on a personal laptop.

## Pre-requisits 

- Be able to write Curl commands 
- Be able to execute powershell commands (if you don't have access to linux/mac) andBe able to write Invoke web request (same as curl)
- Be able to use RegEx (regular expressions)


## JENKINS & SCRIPTING  

- Get access to jenkins, or install Jenkins on your personal machine. 
- If you installed on a personal machine - add plugins, for example google `jenkins pipeline plugin` and add it to jenkins. **NOTE** do not do this step on the Barclays Jenkins instance. 
- Create a Jenkins freestyle project
- Have the project write `Hello Barclays` to the console (either execute shell for linux or execute windows batch command for windows)
- Have Jenkins write the above message to a file
- Write a second job to move that file from one location to another 
- Have the second job, check if the file exists in the destination location. If it does, rename the new file as the filenameVersion1.1
- Each time increment the new file name by 0.1 (hint - make the final filename a combination of two variables $filename & $fileversion, the $fileversion is a number that gets incremented).
- Connect those two jobs together so that when the first is run successfully, the second automatically runs.
- Write a third job to check this file location, if a new version is added then add this to a git/stash branch.
- Obtain access to run command line arguments in Linux, Macos either via Work Computer or personal laptop. 
- Create a Jenkins job that polls a Code repository in Stash or Git for a change, when there is a change have the job write 'Your repository has been changed!'
- Amend the same job that polled the repo, to pull the code down locally.
- Amend your very first jenkins job that displays `Hello Barclays`  to also pull information from a website using curl command. If it is windows, you will need to download powershell and do the equivalent command.
- Have the Jenkins job say `Hello Barclays`  and also `The time is ` and add the time value that you pull in a curl command. I.e. your curl job should pull the time from a website or google page that displays it. 


- Create a jenkins job to write some html to file, ensure that you can click on the file and open it: example html below. 

```
<html>

<h1> Hello Everyone, this is my first simple website </h1>

<body>

This is running on my browser as a **static file** this means it does not change. <br>
To have this as a real useful website, I would need to **host** it so that the public would have access. A **Dynamic** webpage is one that changes, for example it could load new information in real time from a database.

</html>

```

- Make sure the file is saved as index.html (why do you think the html affix matters? )


## Configuration Management Ansible / Chef

**DIFFICULT**  

- Install either on your personal machine
- Write a simple playbook/cook book 



# ADVANCED TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES (Optional)

1. Write a webook (any kind but ideally one that does something when you push code to stash/git)
2. Set up Apache server on your personal computer
3. Have the server host the html file you wrote above
4. Change the port on which the server runs


# KEY BARCLAYS DELIVERY ITEM 

Note this task is very difficult, but it would result in a tangible and very useful deliverable feature for the DevOps team and the bank. As this is a problem we are struggling to implement, but by no means define your learning on the ability to complete the below objective. It should be treated as a stretch goal. 

## OBJECTIVE STRETCH GOAL

Using the knowledge you have obtained from Jenkins, Scripting and Configuration management (using Chef/Ansible) set up a jenkins job to use Ansible (easier) or Chef (harder - but preferred by the bank) to execute restart of applications on Dev servers in Barclays.
