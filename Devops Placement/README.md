# LEARNING RESOURCES

What makes DevOps so powerful and sought after a profession is the wide range of skills required. A DevOps specialist must have degrees of experience with - Development, Testing (functional and Quality), Operations, Systems Administration and more. This is because as a DevOps specialist you are responsible for the underlying infrastructure which those Dev, testing and others run on. Duties can invole any of the following and more: 

- Scripting 
- Automation
- System Administration 
- Application Configuration
- Tooling (selecting the best tools for the team to use)
- Team Dashboarding (making a dashboard to centralise data visualization for the team)
- CICD piepline (building a pipleine in Jenkins to deliver end to end)


Also crucially what differenciates a DevOps engineer from others is the close relation to business, so much so that DevOps engineers often have to think laterally as how to help solve problems from the following points of view:

Scalability 
Does this feature, product have the ability to grow to meet customer demand. A DevOps engineer solves this problem by building infrastructure that grows and shrinks as required.

## PLURALSIGHT 

All Barclays employees have free access to Pluralsight, below are some links I strongly recommend working through.



Devops can be thought of a combination of three main practices - People, Processes and Tools. Succesful automation and Operations require a combinatiton of the right DevOps culture, strong tooling and robust processes which helps both reduce impediments but protects the quality of features being released.


### PEOPLE

### PROCESS

The core working practice behind DevOps is Agile Scrum, infact DevOps has some of the biggest successes with Agile. 

### TOOLS
